## Exercise Details

Stack Overflow is an open community for anyone that writes, reads, or reviews code. It helps members get answers to some of their toughest questions, share knowledge, and find their next dream job.

In this exercise, we’d like to play the part of a Stack Overflow stakeholder asking a question of their data.

> What questions are popular and trending, but not being answered?

To accomplish this - we’d like you to make use of the following tool set. These are either open source or have free trials

* Google Big Query
* dbt
* Github
* StackOverlow Data Set

## Exercise Deliverables

* A dbt project created, developed and tested to a standard you think a data consumer would expect in the time frame allotted. Stored in a public Github repository.
* A Google BigQuery data set, populated with data from the stack overflow sample data set and modeled with dbt to answer the question posed above.
* A data model diagram that provides a visual representation of your data model
